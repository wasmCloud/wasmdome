# Corner Turret Mech

This turret is designed to find the nearest corner, and move towards it to defend a corner. After it has moved to a corner, the turret will continuously fire out in all directions (e.g. if a corner turret has navigated to the SouthWest corner of a grid, it will continually fire in North, NorthEast, and East as it can.)
