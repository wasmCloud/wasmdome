# Assembly Mechs: Beyond WasmDome

_The year is 2020 and our containerized civilization is falling apart. A cruel and villainous DevOps demon named **Boylur Plait** has descended from the cloud to Earth to challenge mankind to a tournament._

## Building a Mech

Developers build robots or _mechs_ for competition in the wasmdome using the [wasmdome sdk](https://docs.rs/wasmdome-mech-sdk). There will be a screencast tutorial available walking developers through the process. Once you've created your mech, compiled it, and signed it (the new mech template comes with a `Makefile` pre-configured to generate your keys and sign your mech properly), you're ready to compete.

## Pre-Requisites

Run the following commands to make sure that you have the latest versions of all the required tools:


#### Install Nats
```
curl -sf https://gobinaries.com/nats-io/nats-server | sh
```

#### Install Rust (Optional)
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

#### Install Required Rust Packages
```
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo install wascap --features "cli" --force
cargo install nkeys --features "cli" --force
cargo install wascc-host --features "bin lattice manifest" --force
```

#### Download and Install Wasmdome Dev Kit
Source code and precompiled binaries for multiple platforms are available under the [releases](https://github.com/wascc/wasmdome/releases) tab.

The following is a list of the tools you'll need to compete on or offline:

* **NATS Server** - You can use `brew` to install it on a Mac, or run `curl -sf https://gobinaries.com/nats-io/nats-server | sh` to install the NATS server on _any_ supported OS and architecture. Don't worry, the NATS binary is less than _20MB_
* **wascap** - You'll need the `wascap` tool so you can embed secure tokens in your WebAssembly modules.
* **nk** - You'll need the `nk` tool to generate the ed25519 keys required to sign secure tokens. 
* **wascc-host** - You'll need `wascc-host` to be able to host actors and capability providers. 
* **WasmDome Dev Kit** - Install the dev kit appropriate for your system. You can find the ZIP files in the [releases](https://github.com/wascc/wasmdome/releases) section of the WasmDome repository. These ZIP files contain a bundle of pre-signed NPCs that you can use in your offline matches, the `wasmdome` CLI tool, and the WasmDome Engine _capability provider_.

## Competing Offline

With all of the pre-requisites set up, and NATS server running (you can run `./nats-server -a 127.0.0.1` to start up an isolated server that supports [waSCC lattice](https://wascc.dev/docs/lattice/overview/)), you can use the `wasmdome` CLI to guide you through the process of running your own local WasmDome arena.

## Competing Online

To compete in the online WasmDome arena, you'll want to register at [wasmdome.dev](https://wasmdome.dev). Follow the instructions online and once a match is coming up soon, you'll be able to use the `wasmdome` CLI to claim a set of credentials that you can use to tell your NATS server to run as a _leaf node_ connected to the live, public lattice where the matches take place. You'll be able to see your mech appear in the lobby as soon as you join the public lattice.
